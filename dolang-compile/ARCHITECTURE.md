# Compiler Frontend Architecture (dolang-compile)

The `dolang-compile` crate transforms Do source code into bytecode through a
multi-phase pipeline: lex → parse → elaborate → lower → emit. Lexical analysis
converts indentation into explicit indent/dedent tokens. Parsing uses recursive
descent with Pratt expression parsing to build an AST. Elaboration performs name
resolution and validates control flow. Lowering converts the AST to a control
flow graph. Emission translates the CFG into bytecode. The `Compiler` type
orchestrates the process and maintains shared tables (source lines, symbols,
interned strings, constant pool, diagnostics).
